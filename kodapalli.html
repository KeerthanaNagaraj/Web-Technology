	The Kondapalli Fort is also known as the Kondapalli Killa. It is located in the Krishna District of Vijayawada. It was built by Prolaya vema Reddy of the Kondavid Dynasty. Initially it was a pleasure palace and a center for the business disculssions of the kingdom along with the Kondavid Fort in the Guntur District.

The forest area around is full of the ponuku tress. These are famous for their lightwood which is used for the famous traditional toys of the Kondapalli area. The fort was built in 1360 by the Reddy dynasty and then passed on to the Gajapati rulers of Orissa, then to Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara Empire and then in the hands of the Muhammedan rulers. Much later it was acquired by the British East India Company Authorities. The fort was even acquired by the famous Nizam-ul-Mulk of the mughal Empire for some time in the 16th century.

At the far end of the Fort complex is the Tanisha Mahal which is in the crest in between two hills. It is completely in ruins now but it can be found that when it was in a good state, it had a floor with many chambers and beautifully carved towers and on the upper floor was a huge hall. There is also a deep reservoir on a lovely spring here. The spring water is said to be so cold that it causes fever. There is also a British Barrack with 8 large rooms and a separate annexure as well. There is also a British Cemetery adjoining the fort complex.
